== Datagram channels ==

Datagram channels are a mild abstraction of UDP sockets.  They are a disjoint type.

See NetworkEndpointsCowan for network endpoints, an abstraction of a host or address plus a port number.  Several of the following procedures accept or return endpoints.

== Procedures ==

`(make-datagram-channel `[''endpoint'']`)`

Returns a new datagram channel suitable for sending and receiving datagrams.  ''Endpoint'' specifies the local endpoint of the channel; if it is omitted, the endpoint will specify any local address and a port specified by the operating system, the equivalent of `(make-network-endpoint #t 0)`. In Posix terms this is `socket()` immediately followed by `bind()`.

`(make-output-only-datagram-channel)`

Returns a newly allocated datagram channel only suitable for sending datagrams.  It is not bound to any port.  In Posix terms this is `socket()`.

`(datagram-channel? `''obj''`)`

Returns `#t` if ''obj'' is a datagram channel and `#f` otherwise.

`(datagram-channel-local-endpoint`''channel''`)`

Returns the local endpoint or `#f` if there is none.  The value returned may not be the same as the value passed to `make-datagram-channel` (in particular, the port must not be 0), but it must be acceptable to another invocation of `make-datagram-channel`.

`(datagram-channel-send-to `''channel''` `''endpoint''` `''bytevector''` `[[''start''|[''end'']]]`)`

Send the portion of ''bytevector'' defined by ''start'' (inclusive) and ''end'' (exclusive) to ''endpoint'' using ''channel''.  If ''end'' is omitted, it is the length of ''bytevector'' plus one; if ''start'' is omitted, it is 0.  Returns undefined values.  In Posix terms this is `send()`.

`(datagram-channel-receive-from `''channel''` `''bytevector''` `[[''start''|[''end'']]]`)`

Receives a datagram from ''channel'' into the portion of ''bytevector'' defined by ''start'' (inclusive) and ''end'' (exclusive).  If ''end'' is omitted, it is the length of ''bytevector'' plus one; if ''start'' is omitted, it is 0.  Returns two values: the sending endpoint and `#t` if the datagram was complete or `#f` if it was truncated.  It is an error to invoke this procedure on an output-only datagram channel.  In Posix terms this is `recvfrom()`.

`(datagram-channel-connect! `''channel''` `''endpoint''`)`

Connects ''channel'' to a remote ''endpoint''.  This endpoint may be on the local host, but it is an error for the port to be 0.  Datagrams can be sent to this endpoint using `datagram-channel-send`, but it is still possible to send datagrams to other endpoints using `datagram-channel-send-to`.  When connected, a datagram channel will ignore any arriving datagrams that do not come from the specified remote endpoint.  Returns undefined values.  In Posix terms this is `connect()`.

`(datagram-channel-disconnect! `''channel''`)`

Disconnects ''channel''.  Returns undefined values.  In Posix terms this is `connect()` with an argument whose address family is `AF_UNSPEC`.

`(datagram-channel-remote-endpoint `''channel''`)`

Returns the remote endpoint to which ''channel'' is connected, or `#f` if it is not connected.  The value returned need not be the same as the value passed to `datagram-channel-connect!`, but must be acceptable to another invocation of `datagram-channel-connect!`.

`(datagram-channel-send `''channel''` `''bytevector''` `[[''start''|[''end'']]]`)`

Send the portion of ''bytevector'' defined by ''start'' (inclusive) and ''end'' (exclusive) to the remote endpoint of ''channel''.  If ''end'' is omitted, it is the length of ''bytevector'' plus one; if ''start'' is omitted, it is 0.  It is an error if ''channel'' is not connected.  Returns undefined values.  In Posix terms this is `send()`.

`(datagram-channel-close `''channel''`)`

Close the underlying UDP port and abandon the channel.

== Example: TFTP ==

TFTP is a simple UDP-based protocol documented in RFC 1350.  For our purposes, all that matters is that the client sends the first datagram and the server sends exactly one response to each datagram (assuming no loss of packets in transmission).

The server uses `(make-datagram-channel (make-network-endpoint 69))` to create a datagram channel listening on the local UDP port 69 and then uses `(datagram-channel-receive-from `''chan''` `''bytevector''`)` to obtain an initial datagram.  The server then calls `(make-datagram-channel)` to create a new datagram channel listening on a randomly chosen port.  This datagram channel is then connected with `(datagram-channel-connect! `''client-host''` `''client-port''`)` to the client's host and port, and the response to the initial datagram is sent on the new channel.  All further transactions with that client are performed over the newly created channel.

The client starts by using `(make-datagram-channel)` and then `(datagram-channel-connect! `''chan''` (make-network-endpoint `''host''` 69))` to connect to the server.  The initial datagram is sent with `(datagram-channel-send `''bytevector''`)`.  When the server replies, the channel is reconnected with `(datagram-channel-connect! (make-network-endpoint `''host''` `''server-port''`))` and the remaining datagrams are sent over the channel.

== Issues ==

These names are very verbose, but I couldn't think of a better term than `datagram-channel`, which is borrowed from `java.nio.channels.DatagramChannel`.  This API is more powerful than Java's, though.
