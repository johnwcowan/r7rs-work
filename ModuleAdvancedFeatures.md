## Advanced Module System Features

There are a number of features one can include
in a module system beyond simple imports and
exports:

* [ParameterizedModules](ParameterizedModules.md) - also known as `units`
* [ModuleInheritence](ModuleInheritence.md) - a special case of higher-order module
* [ModuleIntrospection](ModuleIntrospection.md) - including various forms of static analysis
* [ModuleVersioning](ModuleVersioning.md) - provided by R6RS
