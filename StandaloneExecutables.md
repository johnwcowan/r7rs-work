The following Schemes can produce standalone executables:

Bigloo, Chicken, Gambit, Owl Lisp, Racket, Rhizome/pi, RScheme, Scheme->C, Stalin

All except Racket compile to C; Racket packages up the necessary materials to make something that can be run from the command line, though with no speed improvements over Racket's conventional JIT.
