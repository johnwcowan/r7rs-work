Keywords look like `:foo`, `foo:`, or `#:foo`, depending on the Scheme implementation:

 * Gauche (and Common Lisp) support `:foo`.

 * Gambit, Kawa (and DSSSL) support `foo:`.

 * Bigloo supports both `foo:` and `:foo` and treats them as the same (in the sense of `eqv?`).

 * Scheme 7 supports both `foo:` and `:foo` and treats them as distinct (in the sense of `eqv?`).

 * MZScheme, Guile support `#:foo`.

 * Chicken supports `#:foo` always, and also allows either `foo:` or `:foo` depending on the setting of a parameter or a startup option.

MIT, Scheme48/scsh, SISC, Chez, SCM, Ikarus, Larceny, Mosh, Scheme 9, SSCM, SXM, VSCM, Chibi don't support any of them.
