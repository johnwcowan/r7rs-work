== Abstract ==

The idea of role-based access control (RBAC) is that there are ''actions'' that can or cannot be performed on ''resources'' by ''principals'', depending on whether or not a principal belongs to a ''role''.  This package allows clients to check what can be done, but it is up to its clients to actually permit or forbid actions based on this information.  Such checks are done relative to a ''rulebase''; all rulebases are entirely independent from each other.

Actions, principals, and roles are all named by symbols.  Actions are typically verbs like `read`, `write`, `modify`, and `delete`; principals are typically nouns, especially proper names; roles are typically plural nouns.  However, any of these can be anything at all.  When setting up a rulebase for use by RBAC, we specify the actions, principals, and roles to be used in that rulebase.  We can also specify ''rules'' of various types.  A rule can say that a principal belongs to a role.  Another kind of rule specifies that a role is a sub-role of another role; this means that all principals belonging to the first role automatically also belong to the second role.

A resource is named by a list of symbols representing a path in an abstract hierarchy.  A rule specifying that a role is ''allowed'' to perform an action on a resource, implicitly means that the role is also allowed to perform the same action on any sub-resources.  For example, if role `updaters` is allowed to perform action `write` on the resource `(localhost pub)`, then it is also allowed to perform that action on the sub-resource `(localhost pub canada)`.  However, if a rule specifies that a role is ''blocked'' from taking a given action on a given resource, then principals belonging to that role cannot perform that action on the specified resource or its sub-resources.  By default, all roles are blocked from performing any action on the empty resource named `()`.  Resources are not declared in a rulebase, but are deduced from their presence in allow and block rules.

Finally, principals can be members of ''groups'', and groups can belong to roles in the same way that principals can.  We determine if a principal belongs to a group based on procedures that specify which principals are in the group.  A group also has a ''lead member'' declared for it; at query time, if a group's procedures say that the lead member is not part of the group, an error is signaled if an attempt is made to allow or block a group member from taking an action.

== Rulebase constructor ==

`(make-rbac)`

Return a rulebase with no actions, principals, roles, groups, or rules.

== Adding and removing rulebase objects ==

`(rbac-add-action `''rulebase action''`)`

Add the symbol ''action'' to ''rulebase''.

`(rbac-remove-action `''rulebase action''`)`

Remove the symbol ''action'' from ''rulebase''.

`(rbac-add-principal `''rulebase principal''`)`

Add the symbol ''principal'' to ''rulebase''.

`(rbac-remove-principal `''rulebase principal''`)`

Remove the symbol ''principal'' from ''rulebase''.

`(rbac-add-role `''rulebase role''`)`

Add the symbol ''role'' to ''rulebase''.

`(rbac-remove-role `''rulebase role''`)`

`(rbac-add-group `''rulebase group all-members member? lead-member''`)`

Add the symbol ''group'' to ''rulebase'', specifying ''proc'' as the procedure for retrieving and checking group membership
and ''lead-member'' for the lead member of the group.  If ''all-members'' is called with no arguments, it returns a list of all
the principals in the group.  If ''member?'' is called with one argument, a principal, it returns `#t` if the principal is a member of the
group and `#f` otherwise.

`(rbac-remove-group `''rulebase group''`)`

== Adding and removing rulebase relationships ==

`(rbac-add-in-role `''rulebase principals role''`)`

Adds a rule specifying that the principals and/or groups in the list ''principals'' belong to ''role''.

`(rbac-remove-in-role `''rulebase principals role''`)`

Removes a rule specifying that the principals and/or groups in the list ''principals'' belong to ''role''.  Note that this is only
effective if exactly the same arguments were passed to `rbac-add-in-role`.

`(rbac-add-subrole `''rulebase subrole role''`)`

Adds a rule specifying that the principals belonging to ''subrole'' also belong to ''role''.

`(rbac-remove-in-role `''rulebase principals role''`)`

Removes a rule specifying that the principals belonging to ''subrole'' belong to ''role''.  Note that this is only
effective if exactly the same arguments were passed to `rbac-add-subrole`.

`(rbac-add-allow `''rulebase role actions resource''`)`

Adds a rule allowing ''role'' to perform any of the actions in the list ''actions'' on ''resource'' or any of its sub-resources.

`(rbac-remove-allow `''rulebase role actions resource''`)`

Removes a rule allowing ''role'' to perform any of the actions in the list ''actions'' on ''resource'' or any of its sub-resources.  Note that this is only effective if exactly the same arguments were passed to `rbac-add-allow`.

`(rbac-add-block`''rulebase role actions resource''`)`

Adds a rule blocking ''role'' from performing any of the actions in the list ''actions'' on ''resource'' or any of its sub-resources.

`(rbac-remove-block `''rulebase role actions resource''`)`

Removes a rule blocking ''role'' from performing any of the actions in the list ''actions'' on ''resource'' or any of its sub-resources.  Note that this is only effective if exactly the same arguments were passed to `rbac-add-block`.

== Compiled rulebases ==

`(rbac-compile `''rulebase''`)`

Checks the ''rulebase'' for consistency: that is, actions, principals, roles, and groups referred to in rules have to exist in the rulebase.  Returns a compiled form of the rulebase which can be efficiently checked; in particular, all groups and roles are expanded to the corresponding list of principals at this time.  The objects and rules defined for compiled rulebases cannot be changed.

`(rbac-allow? `''compiled-rulebase principal action resource''`)`

Returns `#t` if ''principal'' (or some group it is a member of) belongs to a role which is allowed to perform ''action'' on ''resource'', as specified by ''compiled-rulebase'', and `#f` otherwise.  Checks that groups include lead members are done at this time.
