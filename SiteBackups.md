# Site Backups

Just so that everyone will be comfortable that this site is backed up properly, here is how backups are done:

* The site is automatically backed up daily to a server at Indiana University.  That server itself is backed up regularly.
* Alex does backups as well, using a separate, manual process.  He has done test restores from these backups.
