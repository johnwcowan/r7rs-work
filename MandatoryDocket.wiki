These are things to consider making mandatory in the large language that are optional in the small language.  See [wiki:WG2Dockets] for other dockets.

Full numeric tower support (bignums, ratios, flonums, compnums)

Forbid mutation of literals

Exact complex numbers

IEEE 64-bit binary inexact numbers

Multiple precisions

Safety

Return exact results on exact arguments whenever possible (e.g. `(sqrt 4)`)

Full Unicode support:
 * all Unicode characters as characters
 * all Unicode characters except perhaps U+0000 in strings
 * all allowed Unicode characters in identifiers

Unicode identifiers

Fixnums must be at least 24 bits signed

Signal an error on all ItIsAnError situations

Provide all R7RS-small libraries:

 * case-lambda
 * cxr
 * eval
 * file
 * inexact
 * lazy
 * load
 * process-context
 * read
 * repl
 * time
 * write

Raise exceptions on all errors

Forcing a non-promise returns the object

Implicit forcing of promises by primitives

Require Unicodely-correct downcasing of Î£.

Support multiple inexact-number precisions

Input/output ports
