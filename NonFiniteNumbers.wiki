== Syntax ==

Here's how various Schemes deal with syntax for non-finite inexact numbers.  "Standard syntax" means what R6RS prescribes: `+inf.0` for positive infinity, `-inf.0` for negative infinity, and both `+nan.0` and `-nan.0` for NaN.

Racket, Gauche, Chicken (with or without the numbers egg), Scheme48, Guile, Kawa, Chez, !Ikarus/Vicare, Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, !IronScheme, STklos, Spark accept and print the standard syntax.

Gambit, Bigloo, Chibi accept and print the standard syntax, except that they do not accept `-nan.0`.

!SigScheme, Scheme 9, Dream, Oaklisp, Owl Lisp are excluded because they do not have inexact non-finite numbers.

The following table concisely describes the other Schemes in the test suite.  "Std syntax" is "yes" if the Scheme can read the standard syntax, "print" shows what `(let* ((i (* 1.0e200 1.0e200)) (n (- i i))) (list i (- i) n))` prints, and "own syntax" is "yes" if the Scheme can reread what it prints.  The implementations are listed in roughly decreasing order of standardosity.

== NaN equivalence ==

The following implementations return `#t` for `(eqv +nan.0 +nan.0)`: Chez, Gambit, Guile, !Ikarus/Vicare, Kawa, Larceny, Racket, STklos.

The following implementations return `#f` for `(eqv +nan.0 +nan.0)`: Bigloo, Chibi, Chicken, Gauche, MIT Scheme, Scheme48.
