`(accumulate-generated-values `*accumulator generator*`)`

Invokes *generator*, passing the value
it returns to *accumulator*.  If the value was an end-of-file
object, `accumulate-generated-values` returns whatever the
accumulator returned.  Otherwise, the process is repeated.

`(gdelete-duplicates `*gen* [ = ]`)`

Creates a generator that returns whatever gen returns, except for any items
that are equal to an earlier item in the sense of =, which defaults to `equal?`.
The = predicate is passed exactly two arguments,
of which the first was generated by gen before the second.

```
(generator->list (gdelete-neighbor-dups (list->generator '(a a b c a a a d c))))
  â‡’ (a b c a d c)
```

`(genumerate `*gen*`)`

Creates a generator that returns pairs.
The car of each pair is an exact integer counting up by 1 from 0.
The cdr of each pair is the result of *gen*.

`(gchain-generators `*constructor* *operation* ...`)`

Creates a generator from a generator constructor plus
a chain of generator operations.  The first argument is
called with no arguments, the remaining arguments with
one argument.
For example, `(gchain-generators gmake gfoo gbar)` returns the same
generator as `(gbar (gfoo (gmake)))`.

Since it is typically necessary to pass additional arguments to the
constructor and the operations, the arguments to `gchain-generator`
will usually be lambda expressions.  For example:

```
(gchain-generators
  (lambda () (make-iota-generator 100))
  (lambda (g) (gfilter even? g))
  (lambda (g) (ggroup 5 g)))
```

returns a generator that outputs the values
`(0 2 4 6 8)`, `(10 12 14 16 18)`, ... `(90 92 94 96 98)`.

Such calls can be written more compactly using the `cut` macro from
[SRFI 26](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-26/srfi-26.html):

```
(gchain-generators
  (cut make-iota-generator 100)
  (cut gfilter even? <>)
  (cut ggroup 5 <>))
```
