`(accumulate-generated-values `*accumulator generator*`)`

Invokes *generator*, passing the value
it returns to *accumulator*.  If the value was an end-of-file
object, `accumulate-generated-values` returns whatever the
accumulator returned.  Otherwise, the process is repeated.

`(gdelete-duplicates `*gen* [ = ]`)`

Creates a generator that returns whatever gen returns, except for any items
that are equal to an earlier item in the sense of =, which defaults to `equal?`.
The = predicate is passed exactly two arguments,
of which the first was generated by gen before the second.

```
(generator->list (gdelete-neighbor-dups (list->generator '(a a b c a a a d c))))
  â‡’ (a b c a d c)
```

`(genumerate `*gen*`)`

Creates a generator that returns pairs.
The car of each pair is an exact integer counting up by 1 from 0.
The cdr of each pair is the result of *gen*.

`(nameTBD `*constructor* *operation* ...`)`

Something to create a generator from a generator constructor plus
a chain of generator operations.
The leftmost argument represents the innermost operation.
