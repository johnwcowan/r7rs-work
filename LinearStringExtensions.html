<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
Scheme specifies mutable fixed-size strings.
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-118/srfi-118.html">SRFI 118</a>
adds two procedures <code>string-append!</code> and
<code>string-replace!</code> which allow the size of the string to change.
This SRFI provides two linear-update versions of these procedures:
that is, the implementation may change the string size or return a
new string instead.
 
</p><h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>
Historically Scheme has only supported fixed-size strings.
Schemes that support SRFI 118 or
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-140/srfi-140.html">SRFI 140</a>
provide fixed-size immutable strings and variable-size
mutable strings, as the usefulness of standard Scheme's fixed-size mutable strings is
extremely minimal: The main use is for a buffer to which one incrementally
adds more data.  So why not fold that functionality into the string API?
That is, why can't you add just data to the end of a string?
</p><p>
The difficulty is that only a few Scheme implementations provide such
strings, and therefore variable-size strings are inherently not portable.
This SRFI provides a useful compromise that takes advantage of
implementation-specific variable-size strings where they exist, and simulates
them where they do not.  Note that a native implementation probably
copies the underlying characters, and therefore is <i>not</i> necessarily
more efficient.

</p><h1>Specification</h1>
<p>
We add two new functions.  The most frequently used is likely to be
<code>string-linear-append!</code>, while <code>string-linear-replace!</code>
handles the general case of replacement of a substring
with another string of possibly different size.</p>

</p><pre>(<b>string-linear-append!</b> <var>string</var> <var>value</var> ...)
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
This procedure returns a string which extends <var>string</var> by
appending each <var>value</var> (in order) to the end of <var>string</var>.
The result can either be <var>string</var> itself or a newly allocated string.
In either case, any references to <var>string</var>
other than the result of this procedure
must be treated as "dead" and never referred to again.
This must be so, since you can't rely on the value passed to a
linear-update procedure after that procedure has been called. It might
be unchanged; it might be altered.
</p><p>
A <var>value</var> can be a character or a string.
</p><p>
The following example shows how to process a string using
<code>string-for-each</code> and incrementally <q>building</q> a result string
using <code>string-linear-append!</code>:</p>
<pre>(define (translate-space-to-newline str)
  (let ((result (make-string 0)))
    (string-for-each
     (lambda (ch)
       (cond ((char=? ch #\Space)
              (string-linear-append! result #\Newline))
             ((char=? ch #\Return)) ; Ignore
             (else
              (string-linear-append! result ch))))
     str)
    result))
</pre>
<p>There is no requirement that this procedure execute in constant time,
even amortised (i.e. average) constant time.
<p><em>Usage note:</em> Compare with using string ports:</p>
<pre>(define (translate-space-to-newline str)
  (let ((out (open-output-string)))
    (string-for-each
     (lambda (ch)
       (cond ((char=? ch #\Space)
              (write-char #\Newline out))
             ((char=? ch #\Return)) ; Ignore
             (else
              (write-char ch out))))
     str)
    (get-output-string out)))
</pre>
<p>Using a string port in this situation is probably preferable:
It is more portable, and you can expect decent performance in most
implementations.  Using <code>string-linear-append!</code> may be slightly
more efficient on some implementations, due to lower overhead,
but that depends on the strategy used by <code>string-linear-append!</code>
when the allocated buffer is too small.
The <code>string-linear-append!</code> function is most useful when
using (reading) a string is interleaved with growing it,
or when also using <code>string-linear-replace!</code>.
</blockquote>

<pre>(<b>string-linear-replace!</b> <var>dst</var> <var>dst-start</var> <var>dst-end</var> <var>src</var> [<var>src-start</var> [<var>src-end</var>]])
</pre>
<blockquote>
Returns a string which has the same characters as <var>dst</var>,
except that the characters between
<var>dst-start</var> and <var>dst-end</var> have been replaced
with the characters of the string
<var>src</var> between <var>src-start</var> and <var>src-end</var>.
The result can either be <var>string</var> itself or a newly allocated string.
In either case, any references to <var>string</var>
other than the result of this procedure
must be treated as "dead" and never referred to again.
This must be so, since you can't rely on the value passed to a
linear-update procedure after that procedure has been called. It might
be unchanged; it might be altered.
</p><p>
The number of characters from <var>src</var> may be different than the
number replaced in <var>dst</var>, so the result may be larger or smaller
than the previous size of <var>dst</var>.
The special case where <var>dst-start</var> is equal to <var>dst-end</var>
corresponds to insertion; the case where <var>src-start</var> is equal
to <var>src-end</var> corresponds to deletion.
The order in which characters are copied is unspecified,
except that if the source and destination overlap, copying takes
place as if the source is first copied into a temporary string and
then into the destination. (This can be achieved without allocating
storage by making sure to copy in the correct direction in such circumstances.)
<p>
When <var>value</var> is a string then
<code>(string-linear-append! <var>dst</var> <var>value</var>)</code> is equivalent to
<code>(string-linear-replace! <var>dst</var> (string-length <var>dst</var>) (string-length <var>dst</var>) <var>value</var>)</code>.
<p>
<em>Note:</em>
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-13/srfi-13.html">SRFI 13</a>
and its successors have
a non-destructive version, <code>string-replace</code>, which
takes the arguments in the following order:

<pre>
  (string-replace <var>dst</var> <var>src</var> <var>dst-start</var> <var>dst-end</var> [<var>src-start</var> [<var>src-end</var>]])
</pre>

We adopt a different argument order here to be consistent with
<code>string-copy!</code>, and existing <code>string-replace!</code>
implementations.
</blockquote>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>A portable implementation that always returns a new string
is (not yet) in the repository of this SRFI.  It should not be
used on systems that provide native variable-size strings.
</p><p>
A native implementation is trivial, assuming there is some indirection
between the string object header and the actual stored characters.
(This is not true in all implementations, Chicken for example.)
Whenever the character buffer is full, it needs to be replaced with
a bigger buffer.  If the size of the new buffer is a
fixed multiple of the size of the old buffer then
 <code>string-linear-append!</code> has amortized constant execution time.
(The multiple 1.5 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1100311/what-is-the-ideal-growth-rate-for-a-dynamically-allocated-array">seems a good choice</a>.)
</p><p>
If you have cheap Smalltalk-style <code>becomes:</code> (which is admittedly
unlikely these days) then you can use that when you need to grow a string
beyond its allocated size.
Alternatively, a minor garbage collection can be invoked, which is
what Chicken does when it must expand the bytes used to represent a UTF-8
string as a result of replacing a 1, 2, or 3-byte character with a
2, 3, or 4-byte character.
