This page is about Windows support by Scheme implementations.
It can be assumed that all Schemes run on Linux, and almost all on the BSDs
including Mac OS X, possibly with a little adjustment.
In addition, Linux-on-Windows support in Windows 10 makes all
Schemes portable to Windows, though without full interchange with the
operating system (basically, files and sockets only).

The following Schemes explicitly or implicitly claim to support Windows,
generally via the MinGW compiler:
Racket, Gauche, Gambit, Bigloo, Sagittarius, SCM, Chez,
Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, KSi, SigScheme, Scheme 9, S7,
ÂµScheme, SIOD, XLisp, Elk, SXM, Femtolisp, Owl Lisp


The following Schemes provide universal support
because they are written entirely in a high-level language
(Java unless otherwise noted):
Cyclone (in Scheme), Kawa, SISC, IronScheme (in C#),
JScheme, BDC, Llava
