= Editing Trac Pages in Emacs =

The trac-wiki.el package allows one to view and edit wiki pages in
Trac directly from Emacs.  I've gotten it working with GNU Emacs
23.1.1, but I had to patch it first.  Here's what I did:

 1. I installed [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/xml-rpc.el|xml-rpc.el version 1.6.8]].

 2. I downloaded [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/EmacsWikiEditScript|trac-wiki.el 1.7]].

 3. I made some changes to trac-wiki.el to make it compatibile with
 this version of xml-rpc.el: TracWikiElPatch.  The resulting file,
 which you can install directly, is TracWikiElWithPatch.
