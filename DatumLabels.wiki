I tested datum-label support with the following expression:

{{{
        (let ((x '(#1=(a b) #1))) (eq? (car x) (cadr x)))
}}}

Gauche, MIT, Bigloo, Kawa, Chez, Ikarus, Mosh support the syntax and
return `#t`;

Racket, Chicken, Scheme48/scsh, Chibi (in native mode), SCM, Larceny, Ypsilon, STklos,
Scheme 9 report lexical syntax errors;

Gambit, SISC return `#f` for whatever reason.
