jcowan> Is it okay if I use your code under the MIT license for a future SRFI?
4:02 PM <RhodiumToad> yup, just credit me by name
4:03 PM <jcowan> by what name?
4:03 PM <RhodiumToad> Andrew Gierth  (as I just said in the channel :-)
4:05 PM <RhodiumToad> I may do further improvements to the hex->bin one, I'll let you know if so
4:07 PM <RhodiumToad> I'll also let you know if I put it up somewhere more permanent, if you like
4:07 PM <jcowan> Sure.  I'm going to use this as a compact syntax for bytevectors, not for Scheme code but for Core, a mechanism for transmitting arbitrarily typed structured data through a textual channel
4:08 PM <jcowan> there are five primitive syntaxes: integer, float, "string", {hexstring}, and list.  Each of these can be preceded by #tag, where a tag is alphanumeric.
4:08 PM <jcowan> Thus fractions are #frac(1 2) and not 1/2, complex numbers are #cplx(3 4) and not 3+4i or #C(3 4)
4:10 PM <jcowan> also a tag by itself, like #t #f #null, and an empty tag (which means vector), so #(...)
4:11 PM <jcowan> also symbol
4:12 PM <jcowan> Seven primitive syntaxes: integer, float, {hexstring}, symbol, "string", (list ...), and empty, each optionally preceded by #tag, where tag is 0 or more alphanumerics
4:13 PM <jcowan> pasting link here to have everything in one place: https://dpaste.org/1fES
4:17 PM <RhodiumToad> that link expires in ~23 hours
4:18 PM <jcowan> will snarf it
