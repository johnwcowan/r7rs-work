This is a preliminary list of procedures for the R7RS vector library.  It is an upward compatible extension of the vector libraries of [[http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/|R5RS]], [[http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf|R7RS-small]], and [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-43/srfi-43.html|SRFI 43]], with additional procedures that are analogous to procedures in the [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html|SRFI 1]] list library and the [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-13/srfi-13.html|SRFI 13]] string library.  As a single exception, the `vector-copy` procedure in R7RS-small does not provide the ''fill'' argument present in SRFI 43.

The procedures that are already in R7RS-small will not be overridden by this library, and are included only for completeness.

== Notation ==

* R5RS means the procedure is available in R5RS and R7RS-small

* R5RS+ means the procedure is available in R5RS and with additional functionality in R7RS-small and SRFI 43.

* R7RS means the procedure is available in R7RS-small and SRFI 43.

* SRFI 43 means the procedure is available in SRFI 43.

* SRFI 43+ means the procedure is available in SRFI 43 but additional ''start'' and ''end'' arguments are proposed.

* SRFI 13 means an analogous procedure is available in SRFI 13.

* SRFI 1 means an analogous procedure is available in SRFI 1.

* SRFI 1/13 means an analogous procedure is available in both SRFI 1 and SRFI 13.
