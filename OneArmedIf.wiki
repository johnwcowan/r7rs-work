The Scheme standards say that a one-armed `if` returns an unspecified value if the first argument is false.  The great majority of all Schemes tested have an "unspecified value" value, which is returned as the value of `(if #f #f)` and in other circumstances where the standards say that the value is unspecified.  The printing of this value is often suppressed by the REPL.  The following are exceptions:

`(if #f #f)` => `#f`:  Bigloo, JScheme, Dream, Owl Lisp

`(if #f #f)` => `()`:  NexJ, !TinyScheme, Elk, UMB, Llava, Dfsch, Inlab

`(if #f #f)` => `#t`:  Shoe, !FemtoLisp

`(if #f #f)` => a value which is both `#f` and `()`: XLisp, Rep

SXM returns a closure which when invoked apparently loops forever.

Note that although R6RS allows returning an unspecified number of unspecified values, including no values, no known Scheme implementation actually does so.
