To test whether `'` is a terminator for an identifier, I tested `(list 'a'b)` on 42 Schemes.

Returned `(a b)`:  Racket, Gauche, MIT, Gambit, Chicken, Scheme48/scsh, Kawa, Chibi, Chez, Vicare, NexJ, STklos, KSi, !SigScheme, Scheme 9, BDC, XLisp, Rep, Oaklisp, Spark, Owl Lisp.

Returned `(a'b)`:  Bigloo, Guile, SISC, SCM, Shoe, !TinyScheme, Dream, Scheme 7, Schemik, Elk, UMB, VX, Sizzle, Inlab.

Syntax error: Ikarus, Mosh, !IronScheme, SXI, MScheme.

I suspect that a lot of implementations think it's simplest to just gobble up what they see until they get to an unquestioned delimiter.
