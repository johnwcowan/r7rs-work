I volunteered for this working group because Scheme has made my life
unbearable.  Scheme is so bad that I can't bear to work in it, and yet
Scheme is so good that I can't bear to work in anything else either.
For half of my (admittedly not very long) career, Scheme's uniformity
and elegance have given my mind wings on which I have soared above the
highest peaks, but Scheme's balkanization and non-interoperability
have trapped me in the deepest dungeons.  So I hope that I can
contribute to standardizing the right base on which a garden of
portable libraries can blossom.
