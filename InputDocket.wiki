== WG2 Input Docket ==

This docket contains work items that need to be voted on for possible inclusion into R7RS-large.  See [[:WG2Dockets|WG2Dockets]] for other dockets.

Bidirectional hash maps: HashTablesCowan [Red]

Binary I/O helpers: procedures relevant to reading and writing low-level binary formats, such as
* 8/16/32/64 bit signed/unsigned integers in little-endian/big-endian/network-endian order
* null terminated ASCII strings
* non-byte-aligned bit fields
* seeking to arbitrary positions
* reading/writing packed representations of Scheme records
(see [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-56/srfi-56.html|SRFI 56]])

Custom I/O ports: [[http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-9.html|R6RS]]

Features, allowing libraries to add:

Generators: GeneratorsGauche, [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html|SRFI 41]] [Red]

Greek lambda syntax: define syntax equivalent to "lambda" whose identifier is a single Unicode U+03BB character (http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/3bb/index.htm)

Identifier-syntax: [[http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-14.html#node_sec_11.19|R6RS]]

R6RS versions of `real?`, `rational?`, `integer?`: these are false if the imaginary part is an inexact zero; the issue here is what to name them to avoid confusion

Immutable deques, sets, maps: ImmutableDataStructuresWortman  See also the incomplete ImmutableData proposal.  [Red]

Immutable pairs: ImmutablePairsCowan.  [Red]

Interrupts, timers, signals:

User-specified syntax-transformers:

Convenience package(s) for commonly desired sets of bindings:
* (scheme r7rs-small) - all bindings in the small language
* (scheme r7rs-red) - the Red Edition's bindings
