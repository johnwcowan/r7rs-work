## R7RS Home Page

This is the home page for R7RS, the Revised‚Å∑ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.
This version of Scheme has been divided into a small language, suitable for educators,
researchers, and users of embedded languages; and a large language focused on the
practical needs of mainstream software development.

The report on the small language was finalized on July 6, 2013.
It is available [in PDF format](https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs/src/draft-10/rnrs/r7rs.pdf)
and as [LaTeX source code](https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs/src/draft-10/spec).
There are [errata](R7RSSmallErrata.md).  A complete archive of the
working documents for the small language is available [here](https://small.r7rs.org/).

A concise definition of the first partial edition of R7RS-large, known as 
the [Red Edition](RedEdition.md), was made available in 2016.
It is a frozen copy of the Red Edition ballot plus the names of the libraries.
A single physical document is in preparation.

Similarly, the second partial edition of R7RS-large, known as the [Tangerine Edition](TangerineEdition.md),
was made available in 2019.  It points to the SRFIs (and in one case an R6RS library)
and the numeric tower that the Tangerine Edition requires implementations to
provide.  One Red Edition library was updated in a fully downward compatible way.

For R7RS-small implementations, see [ImplementationSupport](ImplementationSupport.md).
[Larceny](http://larcenists.org) includes all the SRFIs of the Red Edition, though they
are not yet available under their standardized names.  [Chibi](http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme)
version 0.8 (Oxygen) also contains the entire Red Edition, plus a non-standard library
`(scheme red)` that imports and exports them all.  Other implementations will hopefully follow.

For R7RS benchmarks on many Schemes, see
[this graphic](http://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/benchmark.html).
Some adjustments were made to accommodate the differences between Schemes.
