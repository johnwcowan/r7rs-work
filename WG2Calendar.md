I've created a Google Calendar that tracks events relevant to WG2 that anyone may read.  Currently it contains the start and end of the discussion periods for the new SRFIs, and the WG2 voting periods for them too.

Here are ways to access it:

* [In any iCal-compatible application, including Google Calendar itself](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/miburkof8njd9nk49jo17nbfg8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

* [In any RSS reader](https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/miburkof8njd9nk49jo17nbfg8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic)

* [In any Web browser](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=miburkof8njd9nk49jo17nbfg8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York)
