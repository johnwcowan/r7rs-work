# Arthur A. Gleckler's member page

I am a member of Working Group 1.

My home page is here: http://speechcode.com/

I love Scheme, and I write all my personal programming projects in
Scheme.  I'm sneaking Scheme in here and there in side projects at
work, too.

Here's what I wrote to describe myself when I submitted my name to vote on R6RS:

> I've been an avid fan of Scheme since 1984, when I first used it as
> part of the 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I'm looking forward to making the Scheme standard even better in this
round.

On [EditingTracPagesInEmacs](EditingTracPagesInEmacs.md), I describe how to use trac-wiki.el
to view and edit pages on our Trac site directly from Emacs.
