I tried out

{{{
(define-syntax foo
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((foo) (define x 32))))
(foo) => ???
x => ???
}}}

to see whether I got 32 as the value of x or blew up on an error such
as invalid syntax (in the define-syntax) or undefined variable.

PLT,
MIT, Gambit, scsh/Scheme48, Guile, SISC, Chez, Ikarus, Mosh blew up;


Gauche, Chicken, Bigloo, Kawa, SCM, Larceny (in R5RS mode), Scheme 9,
STklos, !SigScheme, SXM, VSCM, Chibi were fine with it and returned 32.
