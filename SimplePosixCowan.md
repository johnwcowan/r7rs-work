## Interfaces

WG2 voted to provide a Posix package, but rejected a "full Posix" package that would provide all 81
headers, 1191 interfaces, and 51 data types from POSIX.
For the current proposal, see
[PosixScsh](http://htmlpreview.github.io?https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/raw/default/PosixScsh.html).

For Posix in Lua, see [PosixLua](PosixLua.md).
