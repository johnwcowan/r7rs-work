
These are the R6RS examples involving !NaNs (already accounted for verbally in the "Implementation extensions" section of R7RS):

{{{
(number? +nan.0)   => #t ; NaN is real but not rational
(complex? +nan.0)  => #t
(real? +nan.0)     => #t
(rational? +nan.0) => #f

                         ; NaN compares #f to anything
(= +nan.0 z)       => #f where z numeric
(< +nan.0 x)       => #f where x real
(> +nan.0 x)       => #f where x real

(zero? +nan.0)     => #f ; NaN is unsigned
(positive? +nan.0) => #f
(negative? +nan.0) => #f

                         ; NaN is mostly sticky
(* 0 +inf.0)       => 0 or +nan.0
(* 0 +nan.0)       => 0 or +nan.0
(+ +nan.0 x)       => +nan.0 where x real
(* +nan.0 x)       => +nan.0 where x real and not exact 0

                         ; Sum of +inf.0 and -inf.0 is NaN
(+ +inf.0 -inf.0)  => +nan.0
(- +inf.0 +inf.0)  => +nan.0

                         ; 0/0 is NaN unless both 0s are exact
(/ 0 0.0) => +nan.0
(/ 0.0 0) => +nan.0
(/ 0.0 0.0) => +nan.0

(round +nan.0)     => +nan.0 ; Nan rounds (etc.) to NaN

(rationalize +inf.0 +inf.0) => +nan.0 ; Rationalizing infinity to nearest infinity is NaN
}}}
