Undigested stuff from UAX #42:

5 Blocks

The blocks child of the ucd describes the blocks. It has one child block element per block, with attributes to describe the extent and name of the block.

[[blocks,|46]] =  
  ucd.content &=
    element blocks {
      element block { 
        attribute first-cp { single-code-point },
        attribute last-cp { single-code-point },
        attribute name { text }} + }?

6 Named Sequences

The named-sequences child of the ucd describes the named sequences. It has one child named-sequence element per named sequence, with attributes to describe the name and sequence.

Similarly, the provisional-named-sequences child of the ucd describes the provisional named sequences.

[[named|sequences, 47]] =  
  ucd.content &=
    element named-sequences {
      element named-sequence { 
        attribute cps { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute name { text }} + }?

  ucd.content &=
    element provisional-named-sequences {
      element named-sequence { 
        attribute cps { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute name { text }} + }?

7 Normalization Corrections

The normalization-corrections child of the ucd describes the normalization corrections. It has one child normalization-correction element per correction, with attributes to describe the code point affected, its old normalization, its new normalization and the version of Unicode in which the correction was made.

[[normalization|corrections, 48]] =  
  ucd.content &=
    element normalization-corrections {
      element normalization-correction { 
        attribute cp { single-code-point },
        attribute old { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute new { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute version { text }} + }?

8 Standardized Variants

The standardized-variants child of the ucd describes the standardized variant. It has one child element standardized-variant per variant. The attributes on that last element capture the variation sequence, the description of the desired appearance, and the shaping environment under which the appearance is different.

[[standardized|variants, 49]] =  
  ucd.content &=
    element standardized-variants {
      element standardized-variant { 
        attribute cps { two-code-points },
        attribute desc { text },
        attribute when { text }} + }?

9 CJK Radicals

The cjk-radicals child of the ucd describes the CJK radicals. It has one child element cjk-radical per radical. The attributes on that last element capture the radical number, the corresponding CJK radical character, and the corresponding CJK unified ideograph.

[[cjk|radicals, 50]] =  
  ucd.content &=
    element cjk-radicals {
      element cjk-radical { 
        attribute number { xsd:string {pattern="[0-9]{1,3}'?"}},
        attribute radical { single-code-point },
        attribute ideograph { single-code-point }} + }?

10 Emoji sources

The emoji-sources child of the ucd describes the emoji sources.

[[datatype|for code points, 51]] =  
  jis-code-point = xsd:string { pattern = "[0-9A-F]{4}" }

[[emoji|sources, 52]] =  
  ucd.content &=
    element emoji-sources {
      element emoji-source {
        attribute unicode { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute docomo { jis-code-point? },
        attribute kddi { jis-code-point? },
        attribute softbank { jis-code-point? } } + }?
