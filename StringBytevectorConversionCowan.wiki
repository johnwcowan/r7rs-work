`(bytevector-<encoding>-ref` ''bytevector'' [[|[ ''start'' ]] ''end'' ] `)`

Returns a newly allocated Scheme string corresponding to the binary value encoded according to ''encoding'' beginning at offset ''n'' in ''bytevector'' and continuing for ''l'' bytes.

`(bytevector-<encoding>-set!` ''bytevector n v''`)`

Converts ''v'' to a binary string encoded according to ''encoding'' and places it into ''bytevector'' beginning at offset ''n''.  Returns the number of bytes encoded.
