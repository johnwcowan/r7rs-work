Proposal for core and standard modules:

1) Every identifier and syntax keyword defined in the core (that is, not as part of any module) MUST be provided by every conformant implementation.

2) Conformant implementations MAY provide any standard module, and SHOULD provide all of them.

3) Every conformant implementation that provides a standard module MUST provide the whole module.
