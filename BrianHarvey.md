I'm a "Lecturer with Security of Employment" (a tenured full time teacher) at the University of California, Berkeley, where I teach SICP to about 600 students/year, along with a course on Social Implications of Computing and other things.  My SICP lecture notes and videos are online at [http://wla.berkeley.edu/cs61a] and other course materials are at [http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a].  SICP is our first course for CS and EECS majors.  We offer a "zeroth" course for people without programming background, also Scheme-based, using my book ''Simply Scheme'' [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html].

I started out as a PDP-10 systems hacker at the MIT and Stanford Artificial Intelligence Labs, until one day a burning bush appeared before me and told me what I really wanted to do was teach.  Well, two burning bushes actually: a copy of ''Summerhill'' that a housemate left lying around the living room, and, a little later, starting to hang out around the MIT Logo lab.  I was a high school teacher ([http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/freedom.html]) for a while before starting to teach freshmen at Berkeley in 1987, where I discovered SICP, and where I've been teaching it ever since.

For fun I teach fifth graders, using Scratch ([http://scratch.mit.edu]).  I'm involved in a project to add lambda to Scratch!  (We're planning to use the augmented Scratch as the basis for a new zeroth course at Berkeley, which will be only half programming and the other half "big ideas.")

I also run the Berkeley Logo development effort and am the author of ''Computer Science Logo Style'', a trilogy of CS books for teenagers [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html].
