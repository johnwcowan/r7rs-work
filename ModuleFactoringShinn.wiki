I propose the following changes from the first draft:

* Rename (scheme io) as (scheme io base)
* Add (scheme io) as a convenience composite of all four I/O modules
* Move interaction-environment to the (scheme eval) module
* Move case-lambda to a new (scheme case-lambda) module
* If exact-integer-sqrt still returns multiple values, move it to a new module
* Rename (scheme unicode) to (scheme char)
* Move char-alphabetic?, char-numeric?, char-upper-case?, char-lower-case? and char-whitespace? to (scheme char)
* Move the normalization procedures to (scheme char normalization)

Depending on discussion, I would consider moving
the following out of the core:

* syntax-rules
* define-record-type
* blob procedures
* string-ref and string-set!
