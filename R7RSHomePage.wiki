This is the home page for R7RS, the Revised‚Å∑ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.  This version of Scheme has been divided into a small language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users of embedded languages; and a large language focused on the practical needs of mainstream software development.

The report on the small language was finalized on July 6, 2013.  It is available [[http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf|in PDF format]] and as [[http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs-small-spec.zip|LaTeX source code]].  There are [[:R7RSSmallErrata|errata]].

A concise definition of the first partial edition of R7RS-large, known as the [[RedEdition|Red Edition]], is now available.  It is a frozen copy of the Red Edition ballot plus the names of the libraries, which were passed by unanimous consent.  The results, which are now final, can be seen at [[http://tinyurl.com/wg2-red-results|http://tinyurl.com/wg2-red-results]].  A single physical document is in preparation.

For R7RS-small implementations, see ImplementationSupport.  [[http://larcenists.org|Larceny]] includes all the SRFIs of the Red Edition, though they are not yet available under their standardized names.  Other implementations will hopefully follow.

For R7RS benchmarks on many Schemes, see [[http://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/benchmark.html|this graphic]].  Some adjustments were made to accommodate the differences between Schemes.  The source is [[https://github.com/ecraven/r7rs-benchmarks|here]].
