== Symbol case-sensitivity ==

Racket, Gauche, Gambit, Chicken, Bigloo, scsh, Guile, Kawa, Chibi, Chez, Vicare, Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, !IronScheme, NexJ, KSi, !SigScheme, Shoe, RScheme, Scheme 7, BDC, Rep, Schemik, Llava, Sizzle, Spark, Femtolisp, Dfsch, Owl Lisp return `#f` to `(eq? 't 'T)`.

MIT, Scheme48, SISC, SCM, STklos, !TinyScheme, Scheme 9, Dream, XLisp, Elk, UMB, VX, Oaklisp, SXM, Inlab return `#t`.

== Preferred case is upper case ==

I also decided to check the case-insensitive implementations using `(string=? (symbol->string 't) "T")` to see which ones converted symbols to upper case internally.  Only XLisp (which is not really Scheme-compliant) and Oaklisp (which is somewhat R3RS-compliant) did so.
