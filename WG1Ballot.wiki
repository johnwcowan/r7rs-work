=== #32 user-defined types ===

Do we support any means of creating disjoint user-defined types, such
as in SRFI-9, SRFI-99 or the R6RS record system?

WG1 voted '''srfi-9''' before.  New arguments against filter
constructors were raised, so the ticket was re-opened.

=== #28 binary I/O ports ===

Do we provide any binary input or output ports, and if so how do we
construct them and operate on them?  Can binary and textual operations
be mixed on the different port types?

PortsCowan provides binary port operations along with other
extensions.

R6RS provides an entirely new I/O system, as well as a separate
R5RS-compatible I/O system.

The withdrawn SRFI-91 provides yet another I/O system supporting
binary ports.

Note this item as well as #29 and #31 specify semi-orthogonal aspects
of I/O systems which are typically specified together by individual
proposals.  If the same proposal doesn't win for all three, the
aspects will be merged as needed.

WG1 voted weakly in favor of '''cowan''' before.

=== #83 Auxiliary Keywords ===

In R6RS auxiliary keywords (such as `else` in `cond` and `case` forms)
are explicitly exported from the `(rnrs base (6))` library.  Do we
want to bind and export these from the core library?

If `else` is bound in the default module, then it must be imported at
the call site whenever using it in `cond` or it won't match
hygienically.

If `else` is '''not''' bound in the default module, then it must not
be bound or imported at the call site whenever using it in `cond` or
it won't match hygienically.

Another option is to specify for `cond` and `case` that they match the
`else` identifier literally, ignoring any hygiene.  This breaks
compatibility with R5RS and R6RS.

WG1 voted '''unbound''' previously.  New issues were brought up on the
list so the ticket was re-opened.

=== #3 module naming convention ===

We need a naming convention for the core modules and standard
libraries of the new module system.

The existing break down is based on John Cowan's earlier proposal of
factorings in items #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76, #77, as well as an
I/O module breakdown in PortsCowan.  There have been various tickets
proposing changing this, so we are re-opening the ticket.

== WG1 - Core ==

=== #85 Blobs, bytevectors, byte-vectors, octet-vectors, or something else? ===

Now that we have blobs, we have to decide what to call them.  R6RS
uses bytevector, SRFI-4 and SRFI-68 uses u8vector, while the original
WG1 proposal used blob (which is therefore the default).

  * '''Options:''' blob, bytevector, byte-vector, u8vector, octet-vector, undecided
  * '''Default:''' blob
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #118 Simple literals must be explicitly delimited. ===

In R5RS syntax such as `#t#f` is left unspecified - some readers may
parse this as the true literal followed by false.  R6RS requires
identifiers, characters, booleans, number objects, and `.` to be
terminated with a "delimiter" or by the end of input.

=== #119 Whether to treat # as a delimiter. ===

In R5RS `foo#f` is a valid identifier, whereas R6RS requires `#` to
act as a delimiter, so that this would parse as the identifier `foo`
followed by the false literal.

  * '''Options:'''  delimiter, no, undecided
  * '''Default:''' no
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #123 Extend unquote and unquote-splicing to multiple arguments ===

This is a change also made by R6RS (and CL).

This is a change also made by R6RS, specifically:

> A quasiquote expression may return either fresh, mutable objects or literal structure
> for any structure that is constructed at run time during the evaluation of the expression.
> Portions that do not need to be rebuilt are always literal

  * '''Default:''' r5rs
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #127 Specify the dynamic environment of the ''before'' and ''after'' procedures of dynamic-wind ===

R5RS is slightly ambiguous, saying

> BEFORE is called whenever execution enters the dynamic extent of the
> call to THUNK and AFTER is called whenever it exits that dynamic
> extent.

without saying clearly whether ''before'' and ''after'' themselves are
called before or after the dynamic extent is entered or exited.

=== #135 let-values and let*-values ===

values), but were never explicitly voted up or down by WG1, so I'm
opening a new ticket for them.

=== #137 Current-seconds semantics still open ===

In issue #70, WG1 voted to make `current-seconds` an optional
procedure, but there is no guidance about what it returns.  The second
choice, TimeCowan, calls it `current-posix-second` and makes it return
the integral number of seconds since the Posix epoch, excluding all
leap seconds.  We need a final decision on name and semantics.

Need proposals.

  * '''Options:''' 
  * '''Default:''' 
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #147 Allow literal file spec lists in include and include-ci ===

This could allow implementation-specific extensions to support files
don't have character-string names.  On the other hand, such names
probably shouldn't be used as source files, and there are other ways
to support this.

  * '''Options:''' yes, no, undecided
  * '''Default:''' no
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #148 Allow include-ci at top level ===

Currently `include-ci` is allowed as a module declaration but not at top level,
as `include` is.

  * '''Options:''' yes, no, undecided
  * '''Default:''' no
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #149 blob ports ===

We've voted to add string ports, which are character ports backed by
Scheme strings.  Since we have blobs another potential extension is
blob ports, which binary ports backed by blobs.  These are described
in PortsCowan, but it's unclear if they were specifically voted for or
against in the previous ballot.

  * '''Options:''' cowan, none, undecided
  * '''Default:''' none
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #150 cond-expand at top level ===

Currently `cond-expand` is only valid as a module declaration.  Should
we allow it at top level in a program?

  * '''Options:''' yes, no, undecided
  * '''Default:''' no
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #153 Renaming blob procedures ===

The blob procedures don't follow the same system as the rest.  I
propose these changes:

{{{
copy-blob => blob-copy
copy-blob! => blob-copy!
partial-blob => blob-copy-partial
copy-partial-blob! -> blob-copy-partial!
}}}

Note this is modulo the choice of "blob" or "bytevector"
or whichever.

  * '''Options:''' new, original, remove, undecided
  * '''Default:''' original

=== #154 Physical newline in a string equivalent to \n (that is, U+000A) ===

R5RS leaves this situation undefined, but R6RS, CL, and most languages
that allow it (C does not) treat physical newline and escaped newline
as equivalent, even if the local representation of line endings is
\r\n or U+0085 or what not.  Another possibility is to treat string literals
broken across lines as errors.

  * '''Options:''' unix, local, error, unspecified, undecided
  * '''Default:''' unspecified
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #155 Make recursively defined code an explicit error ===

Allowing examples like these will make code-walkers (including
compilers and interpreters) excessively complicated:

#1=(begin (display #\x) . #1#)

(lambda #2=(a b c #2#) ...)

(+ . #3=(1 2 3 . #3#))

  * '''Options:''' error, unspecified, undecided
  * '''Default:''' unspecified
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #156 Replace "an error is signalled" with "an implementation-dependent object is raised as if by `raise`" ===

The following situations are described in draft 1 (and R5RS) with "an
error is signalled":

 1. The ''file-spec'' given to `call-with-input-file`,
 `call-with-output-file`, `open-input-file`, or `open-output-file`
 represents a file that cannot be opened.

 2. An end of file is read from a port by `read` after the beginning
 of an object's external representation, but the external
 representation is incomplete and therefore not parsable.

I propose that in both cases the implementation be required to raise
an exception as if by applying `raise` (that is, non-continuably) to
an implementation-defined object, which means it can be caught by the
R7RS exception system.  Note that there is no requirement to create a
fresh object.

  * '''Options:''' signal, unspecified, undecided
  * '''Default:''' unspecified
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #162 Remove DELAY and FORCE altogether ===

They are present in R4RS and R5RS, but not IEEE Scheme (which is our
baseline).  There are problems with a straightforward implementation
that SRFI 45 fixes, but we voted down SRFI 45.  Given that, we should
consider removing them from the standard altogether.  (Of course this
does not mean compliant implementations can't provide them, it just
means they won't be in a standard module.)

Since the inconsistency was raised and people are going so far as
to remove these, we can entertain votes for SRFI-45's `lazy` again.

  * '''Options:''' remove, keep, lazy, undecided
  * '''Default:''' keep
  * '''Preferences:''' 

=== #164 Meaning of char-numeric? ===

The current draft, like R6RS, defines `char-numeric?` according to the
nonexistent Unicode Numeric property.  That has to be fixed.  Options:

 1. `char-numeric?` returns `#t` if the character's Numeric_Type
 property value is other than `None`.  This means that many hanzi are
 both alphabetic and numeric.

 2. (Omitted, because it does not preserve IEEE Scheme)

 3. Define `char-numeric?` to return `#t` only for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
 6, 7, 8, and 9.  This retains compatibility witht R5RS, and we can
 still use `char-numeric?` to parse numbers, and safely use `(-
 (char->integer c) (char->integer #\0))` to obtain the digit value the
 character represents.  (Note: R5RS programs that use `char-numeric?`
 to parse numbers will break if we adopt the current draft's
 definition of `char-numeric?`).  Gauche, Gambit, and Chicken (without
 the utf8 egg) work like this.

 4. Define `char-numeric?` as equivalent to the Numeric_Digit property
 (general category value of Nd).  Guile 2.0, Kawa, Larceny, Ypsilon,
 Mosh, and IronScheme work like this.

 5. define `char-numeric?` as equivalent to the Number property
 (general category values of Nd, Nl, No).  Scheme48, Chez, and Ikarus
 work like this.

=== #166 Add predicate and accessors for error objects ===

(Email from Vincent Manis)

Problem: It's impossible to write a portable error handler that writes
out the ''message'' and ''irritants'' that were passed to `error`.

This comes about because `error` creates an "implementation-defined
object". I would assume that this hides the whole exception class
hierarchy a WG2 implementation might provide. Since the ''message''
and ''irritants'' arguments to `error` are presumably living in this
implementation-defined object, it should be simple enough to provide
accessors to extract them, so that the above "portable error handler"
can be written.

Suggestion: Add the following procedures:

`(error-object? `''object''`)`

Returns `#t` if ''object'' is something created by `error`, `#f`
otherwise. Any constraints on type disjointness are up to the
implementation.

`(error-object-message `''object''`)`

Returns the message of ''object''.

`(error-object-irritants `''object''`)`

Returns a list of the irritants of ''object''.

=== #167 Add constructor for error objects ===

(Email from Vincent Manis)

Problem: Raising arbitrary objects as exceptions has been found to be
nasty in some other languages (Python and C++ in particular).

This one is a tad speculative, but I'm reluctant to encourage people
to write things like `(raise 4)`, because of course it doesn't respect
any module boundaries. I think the intent with the descriptions of
`raise` and `raise-continuable` was to allow exception hierarchies to
be added in WG2 without constraining them here. I would suggest adding
a new procedure:

`(make-error-object `''message''` `''obj'' ...`)`

to creates the implementation-defined object `error` is supposed to
create, and adding a sentence to the `raise` and `raise-continuable`
entries that says "The effect of applying this procedure to an object
not created via `make-error-object` is implementation-defined." This
allows WG2 to do what it wants regarding exception objects, and to
limit the types of exception objects allowed, without breaking
anything in WG1. `Error` can be defined as:

{{{
 (define (error message . objs)
   (raise (apply make-error-object message objs)))
}}}

=== #171 Duplicate identifiers in define-record-type ===

What happens if `define-record-type` is specified with two fields that
have the same `accessor` identifiers provided for both fields?  More
generally, we need to say what happens when any two identifiers are
non-unique.

This ticket deals specifically with the situation where two
identifiers (accessors or mutators) of two field clauses in a
`define-record-type` form are identical. This is not meant to address
field names and what happens or what it means if the field names are
symbolically equivalent but lexically distinct.

=== #173 Unifying BEGINs ===

In R5RS, there are three kinds of BEGINs:

1) All subforms are expressions; this can be used wherever an
expression can be used.  (4.2.3)

2) All subforms are definitions; this can be used wherever an internal
definition can be used.  (5.2.2)

3) Subforms can be definitions or expressions intermixed in any order;
this can be used only at top level.  (In R7RS we extend this to module
top level as well).  (5.1)

In particular,

{{{
(define (x)
 (define y 32)
 (begin
   (define z 45)
   (set! y z))
 y)
}}}

is not licensed by any of these provisions, and consequently is not
valid R5RS Scheme.  Nevertheless, all of my usual Schemes accept the
above definition except Scheme48/scsh and SSCM -- actually, SSCM fails
when you invoke x rather than when you define it.  So I'm proposing
that we unify them for R7RS.

=== #174 Safe uses of multiple values ===

Currently, uses of `values` where the values are discarded anyway is
illegal, but all the usual Schemes except SCM and SSCM accept them (I
tested with `begin`).  Should we go with something close to the R6RS
wording?

"The continuations of all non-final expressions within a sequence of
expressions, such as in `lambda`, `begin`, `let`, `let*`, `letrec`,
`letrec*`, `case`, and `cond` forms, take an arbitrary number of
values."

The definition of `begin` would need to change too:

{{{
(define-syntax begin
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((begin exp)
     exp)
    ((begin exp1 exp2 ...)
     (call-with-values
         (lambda () exp1)

=== #45 Record-let syntax and semantics ===

{{{

}}}

Where each <variable> is filled with the corresponding data <field>
from <record-data> as in a <let> expression, then the <body> is
evaluated with these bindinds added and last expressions is
returned. It is an error if the <record-data> does not contain
corresponding <fields>.

Notice that this works directly on the data itself and that the data
may contain more fields than the one cited in the record-let
expression allowing code to be reused for inherited records.

Do we need to be able to check at runtime if a given record data has
a given field ?

=== #178 Shadowing with internal definitions ===

From Andre Von Tonder:

On p 19, some shadowing problems that would break lexical scope are
declared to be errors.  However, I believe there are other examples
that shold be errors that are not covered by the report.
 
In R6RS a more general criterion was used - please see R6RS for
details.
 
Here is an example that does not violate the WG1 report but should be
an error becasue it violates lexical scoping.  It does not violate the
WG1 criterion because the meaning of x is not needed to determine
whether (foo x p ) is a definition.

{{{
    (let ((x #f))
      (let-syntax ((foo (syntax-rules (x)
                          ((_ x y) (define y 'outer))
                          ((_ _ y) (define y 'inner)))))
        (let ()
          (foo x p)
          (define x #f) ;; this should be an error because
                        ;; it shadows the previous line where
                        ;; x has already been used in its outer sense
                        ;; during expansion
          p)))
}}}

Here is another example that WG1 allows but that would cause violation
of lexical scoping, because the macro would be evaluated first and
treat ... as a placeholder in a region where it is shadowed to be the
variable bound to 1:

{{{
    (let ()
      (define-syntax list-macro
        (syntax-rules ()
          ((_ x ...) (list x ...))))
      (define ... 1)    ;; This shadows ... in previously expanded macro
                        ;; body and will be a violation of lexical scoping
      (list-macro 1 2)) ;; if the last line evaluates to (1 2)
}}}

OTOH, it is unclear to me if WG1 allows this or not.

{{{
    (let ((x #f))
      (let-syntax ((foo (syntax-rules (x)
                          ((_ x y) (define y 'outer))
                          ((_ _ y) (define y 'inner)))))
        (let ()
          (define x #f)
          (foo x p)
          p)))

=== #112 REPL redefinitions ===

R5RS leaves unspecified the semantics of redefining a standard binding
in the REPL.  Do we want to specify semantics, or some set of allowed
behavior for this in the WG1 standard?

REPLs may allow redefinition.  The sixteen cases that occur are
redefining to/from syntax/non-syntax locally/imported, and the issue
is what happens to previous references to the definition.  The general
possibilities are:

  1. redefinition signals an error
  2. previous references are overridden (generally not possible if it the previous definition was syntax)
  3. previous references are preserved (indicating a new binding was created, often preferred if replacing non-syntax with syntax to avoid runtime errors)
  4. the semantics are left unspecified

So all 64 combinations for these 4 values in the following 4x4 matrix
are feasible:

|| From/To       || import || import syntax || define || define-syntax ||
|| import        ||   ?    ||       ?       ||   ?    ||       ?       ||
|| import syntax ||   ?    ||       ?       ||   ?    ||       ?       ||
|| define        ||   ?    ||       ?       ||   ?    ||       ?       ||
|| define-syntax ||   ?    ||       ?       ||   ?    ||       ?       ||

Not all 64 combinations necessarily make sense.  The default from R5RS
is "unspecified", which means all 16 values are unspecified.

It would be useful to allow modules as an argument to eval in addition

I'm thinking that for importing code that defines its external symbols

This is equivalent to renaming on import or renaming on export, but
less painful, in the same way as the `prefix` import clause does.

I (Alaric Snell-Pym) wondered if this should be done via

specifying a precision, as a number like `0.01` to get two decimal
places. How to provide significant figures rather than DP without
introducing a base-10 dependency is left as an exercise to the reader

=== #140 Removing `quotient`, `remainder`, `modulo` ===

Are we removing the IEEE Scheme functions `quotient`, `remainder`, and
`modulo` from WG1 Scheme?  If so, we need a special justification, due
to the charter text:

> Existing features of IEEE Scheme may be removed only if a strong
> case can be made that they are fundamentally flawed. Insofar as
> practical, the language should be backwards compatible with the IEEE
> standard, the R5RS standard, and an appropriate subset of the R6RS
> standard.

Here's what DivisionRiastradh says:

> Unfortunately, most programming languages give nondescript names
> such as DIV(IDE), QUOT(IENT), MOD(ULO), and REM(AINDER) to these
> operations. The language should make clear to programmers what
> division operations their programs are performing, especially when

> The R5RS gives the names `quotient` and `remainder` to the
> truncating division operator pair, and the name `modulo` to the
> remainder half of the flooring division operator pair. For all these

> the divisor may be any nonzero integer.

On the other hand, we may prefer relegating them to a
backward-compatibility module.

both the real part and the imaginary part are finite and not `+nan.0`,
and that `nan?` return `#t` on a non-real value iff either the real or

=== #152 exact-integer-sqrt inconsistent with multiple values module ===

R5RS does not actually specify any procedures which return multiple
values, and so the decision to separate multiple values to a module
was reasonable.  However, we also voted to make `exact-integer-sqrt`,
which is in the base module, return multiple values, namely the root
and the remainder.  That would make the procedure useless unless
multiple values are provided.

We can either make multiple values not a module, make
`exact-integer-sqrt` return a list (or single integer) rather than
multiple values, relegate `exact-integer-sqrt` to a new module, remove
it altogether, or do nothing and leave the inconsistency.

Andy Wingo suggests: make the clauses in `case` and `cond` forms

The counter-argument is that it doesn't "look" like the sort of place

=== #183 Escaped newline removes following whitespace? ===

Andy Wingo suggests the R6RS handling of escaped embedded newlines:

{{{
    "asdadf \

}}}

in R6RS has the same meaning as "asdf asdfadf".  It allows you to
nicely indent strings that you need to line-break for width.  I
suggest that the production

{{{
   \ NEWLINE WHITESPACE*
}}}

within string literals be elided.

Note an alternate method for handling embedded strings with nice
indentation is scribble syntax.

We voted on various string syntaxes previously but did not
specifically propose this R6RS extension.  We should have a rationale
if we don't follow it.

=== #184 Require CHAR=?, STRING=? etc. to accept arbitrary numbers of arguments? ===

R5RS makes a point of specifying that supporting more than two
arguments is optional.  (Everything not explicitly mentioned is
optional, so this may have significance.)  R6RS requires accepting 2
or more arguments.  Currently Racket, Gambit, Guile, Chez, Ikarus,
Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, and Scheme 9 support the feature, whereas
Gauche, MIT, Chicken, Bigloo, Scheme48/scsh, Kawa, SISC, Chibi,
STklos, and SSCM don't.

=== #185 Add sixth "centered" division operator ===

From the Guile manual:

— Scheme Procedure: centered/ x y
— Scheme Procedure: centered-quotient x y
— Scheme Procedure: centered-remainder x y

These procedures accept two real numbers x and y, where the divisor y
must be non-zero. centered-quotient returns the integer q and
centered-remainder returns the real number r such that x = q*y + r and
-|y/2| <= r < |y/2|. centered/ returns both q and r, and is more
efficient than computing each separately.

Note that centered-quotient returns x/y rounded to the nearest
integer. When x/y lies exactly half-way between two integers, the tie
is broken according to the sign of y. If y > 0, ties are rounded
toward positive infinity, otherwise they are rounded toward negative
infinity. This is a consequence of the requirement that -|y/2| <= r <
|y/2|.

Note that these operators are equivalent to the R6RS operators div0,
mod0, and div0-and-mod0.

The documentation for `begin' specifies that it is a sequential

spec to say that "begin is for sequencing".

Suggestion: adopt the language of R6RS section 11.4.7.

--Andy Wingo

We should explain somewhere the four kinds of `begin`s: (begin expr

to construct the table will be too large.

We could offer a parameter to control this, or have a separate
procedure (e.g. `write/simple`) which doesn't use the reader labels.
