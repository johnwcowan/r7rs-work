= `let-syntax` Proposal =

By Aaron W. Hsu

== Proposal ==

Remove the `let-syntax` form.

== Rationale ==

`let-syntax` is difficult to specify correctly and can be superseded by the availability of ModulesAndPackagesArcfide. This removes some of the ambiguities and complexities from the R6RS expansion process.
