The following Schemes come with compilers (which does not necessarily mean that they can produce standalone executables):

Native compilers: Chez, Larceny, MIT, Vicare

Compilers to C: Bigloo, Chicken, Cyclone, Gambit, Hotdog (port of Scheme48), Larceny, MIT, Owl Lisp, Rhizome/pi, RScheme, Scheme->C, SCM, Stalin

Compilers to JVM bytecode: Bigloo, Hotdog (port of Scheme48), JScheme, Kawa

Compilers to CLR bytecode: Bigloo, Hotdog (port of Scheme48), !IronScheme, Larceny (older version), Luna

Compilers to private bytecode (with JIT): Pycket (port of Racket to RPython), Racket

Compilers to private bytecode (without JIT):  Chibi, Elk, !FemtoLisp, Foment, Guile, Mosh, Oaklisp, Owl Lisp, Picrin, Rep, RScheme, Sagittarius, Scheme 48, STklos, Shoe(?), SXM, Vx, Unlikely, VSCM, Wraith, XLisp, Ypsilon (probably incomplete)

Tree-walking interpreters: SISC, NexJ, KSi, !SigScheme, !TinyScheme, !MiniScheme, Scheme 9, S7, SIOD, BDC, Schemik, UMB, Llava, Sizzle(?), LMU(?), dfsch, Inlab

Schemes for specialized CPUs are not listed here.  I have not tested most of these compilers.
