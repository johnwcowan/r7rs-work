The following Schemes come with compilers (which does not necessarily mean that they can produce standalone executables):

Native compilers: Chez, Larceny, Vicare

Compilers to C: Bigloo, Chicken, Gambit, Larceny, Owl Lisp, Rhizome/pi, Scheme->C, SCM, Stalin

Compilers to JVM bytecode: Bigloo, Kawa

Compilers to CLR bytecode: Bigloo, !IronScheme, Larceny (older version), Luna

Compilers to private bytecode (with JIT): none known

Compilers to private bytecode (without JIT):  Chibi, Guile, Oaklisp, Owl Lisp, Scheme 48, SXM, Racket, Vx, Wraith (probably incomplete)

Schemes for specialized CPUs are not listed here.  I have not tested most of these compilers.3
