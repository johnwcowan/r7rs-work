== Network Ports ==

Network ports are a mild abstraction of TCP sockets. They are a disjoint type.

In the following descriptions, ''host'' and ''local-address'' are strings, which may be IPv4 dotted-decimal addresses, IPv6 colon-hexadecimal addresses if supported by the operating system, or host names to be looked up according to whatever operating system conventions exist, if any. Appropriate strings may refer to broadcast or multicast addresses. ''Port'' may be an integer or a string; the meaning of a string is implementation-dependent, but is intended to be a standardized service name.

''This proposal is not fleshed out, because we don't yet know how to deal with binary vs. character, buffered vs. unbuffered, encoding, line end conventions, etc.''

== Client Procedures ==

The procedures in this section take a specification for a TCP socket and return a input/output port connected to the socket.

`(open-network-client `''host''` `''port''`)`

Returns an input/output port connected to the remote ''host'' and ''port''.

== Server Procedures ==

`(make-network-listener `[''local-address'']` `''port''`)`

Returns an opaque ''listener'' object (which may be of any type) that will accept connections to the specified ''port'' and ''local-address''.  If ''local-address'' is omitted, the listener will accept connections that are made to ''port'' on any local address.

`(open-network-server `''listener''`)`

Waits for a client to connect to ''listener'', and returns an input/output port connected to that client.
