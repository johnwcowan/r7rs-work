SettingsListsCowan is nice, but would be even better with some syntax for using settings lists in
one's own procedures, perhaps:

`(let-settings (`''keywords''` `''settings-list''`) . `''body''`)`

where ''keywords'' is a list of symbol names to extract from the ''settings-list'',
which will be bound to the named values in the current environment. The
`open-input-process` procedures from ProcessPortsCowan might then be defined thus
for the case where their ''filename'' argument is a list:

{{{
   (define (open-[[input|output|input/output]]-process filename)
     (let-settings ((path arguments environment
                     stdin-redirection stdout-redirection) filename)
       ...
       (execvp path arguments environment) ; or whatever
       ...))
}}}

(It could be written in terms of a `call-with-settings` procedure, of course.)
